An electron app that does nothing but open Roll20, you can sign in and it'll remember.

To setup:
1) Make sure you have node.js installed
2) Clone the repo and navigate to the repo in the terminal of your OS
4) Run npm install to download the dependancies
5) Run npm start to make sure everything is working

Building an executable:
Electron builder is included so on windows you can just do "npm run dist" and it'll build the exe both unpacked and in an installer
